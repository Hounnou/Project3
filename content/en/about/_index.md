{{< figure src="/images/profile.jpg" title="PhD candiate in Informatics/Machine Learning" >}}

I am pursuing a double major in Applied Statistics and Informatics. 
I hold a master's degree in Applied Economics from Oklahoma State University, USA. I have 
more than eight years of experience managing complex data problems, especially in Finance.
My areas of expertise include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining, Predictive Modelling, Econometrics and Financial Risk Management. I have a strong background
in Economics, Programming and Statistics. I am well versed in data cleaning, data manipulation, descriptive statistics and model interpretation using time series analysis, cross-sectional and panel data analysis, causal inference, spatial econometrics and Bayesian statistics. I am conversant with many programming languages including R, Python, SAS,STATA, Java and GIS.
My PhD dissertation is about using Machine Learning
techniques to solve real life problems in Education and Finance. In that endeavor, I compared Bayesian deep learning approach for credit risk modelling to commonly used approaches at financial institutions. 
I developed and deployed models on credit card fraud detection,
customer behavior analysis, the likelihood of marketing engagement and many more.
