title: 'Project 2: Kernel Regression Models'
---

Kernel regression is a non-parametric technique that is useful when the distribution of 
the observed data is unknown. In this project, I wrote two univariate kernel regression
models: Gaussian Kernel and Epanechnikov Kernel. The two models were compared
to a multi-dimensional Kernel in terms of prediction accuracy.
