title: 'Project 3: Adaboost Algorithm'
---

* Boosting is an additive model, but is different from generalized additive model,
in which each weak learner only involves one variable and *p* number of functions
are used and added up.
* Boosting is also different from random forests, another additive model. In 
random forests, each tree is generated independently, so they can't borrow information
from each other.
* Adaboost is a special case of this framework with exponential loss for classification.
