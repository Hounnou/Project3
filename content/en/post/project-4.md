title: 'Project 4: Support Vector Machines (SVM)'
---

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) can be imagined as a surface that defines a
boundary between various points of data which represent examples plotted in
multidimensional space according to their feature values. The goal of an SVM is
to create a flat boundary, called a hyperplane, which leads to fairly homogeneous
partitions of data on either side. In this project, I showed some examples of SVM using 
Quadratic Programming.
