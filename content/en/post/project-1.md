K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is a nonparametric method that predicts the target point
x with averages of nearby observations in the training data. The algorithm is 
simple and effective. It makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
However, it does not produce a model, which limits the ability to find new insights
in relationships among features. 
In this project I wrote my own KNN algorithm which I compared to the model
already available in R.
